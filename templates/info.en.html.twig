   <h2>Procedure of the ballot</h2>
   In the past, ballots have usually been conducted as a straight ballot.
   Due to this year's Corona situation, the Student Council has decided to allow the option of voting by mail.
   <br>
   If at least 10% of the students participate in the vote, it is binding on the student body. If not enough students participate in the vote, there is no binding student recommendation. At worst, this means that there will no longer be a semester ticket (for the train), even if most students want it.
   <h3>Voting by letter</h3>
   Until April 25, 2021, you can <a href="{{ path("postal_voting_register") }}">apply for a postal vote here</a>. To do so, enter your name, email address, and the address to which you want to receive voting materials in the form and submit it.
   You will then receive an e-mail in which you can check your data again and confirm your registration. You will then receive all the necessary documents for the election by mail a few days later. With this, you can vote and return the ballot free of charge.
   <h3>Ballot box voting</h3>
   Voting booths will be available at the dates and locations listed. All students can vote there with their thoska. If you have lost your thoska, a photo ID and mention of your matriculation number will also entitle you to vote.
   <br>
   Due to the Corona situation, there will be a hygiene concept that is being worked out at the moment. More detailed information will be announced here before the ballot.

   <h2>Dates of the ballot</h2>
   Please submit a request to vote by mail by <b>April 25, 2021</b> <a href="{{ url('postal_voting_register') }}">here</a>.<br>
   From <b>April 26, 2021</b> to <b>May 7</b>, inclusive (postmark counts here), the postal voting period will run, during which the ballot can be returned by mail.<br><br>

   The ballot will be held at Carl-Zeiss-Strasse 3 at the following times:
   <table>
      <tr>
         <td><b>Monday 10.05.21</b></td>
         <td>13 - 17 h</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><b>Monday 12.05.21</b></td>

      </tr>
   </table>

   <br>
   The public vote count will be held on May 12, 2021 at 6:00 p.m. in Room 275 (WiWi Faculty Meeting Room) at Carl-Zeiss-Strasse 3.
