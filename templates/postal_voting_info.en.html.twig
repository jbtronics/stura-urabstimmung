<h1>Instructions for voting by letter</h1>

    <h2>Documents supplied</h2>
    You received a voting kit in the mail, which should contain the following items:
    <ul>
        <li><b>1 ballot paper</b> (gray DIN A4 paper)</li>
        <li><b>1 ballot for voting</b> (small colorful printed slip, with german text)</li>
        <li><b>1 ballot paper envelope</b></li>
        <li><b>1 return envelope</b></li>
    </ul>
    You no longer need the gray envelope with window that the documents came in.
    <br>
    If anything is missing, please contact the ballot committee at <a href="mailto:urabstimmung@stura.uni-jena.de">urabstimmung@stura.uni-jena.de</a>.


    <h2>Voting</h2>
    Once you have all the required documents, you can vote:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Fill out the ballot according to your opinion.</b> For each voting text, exactly one cross must be placed at <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>.
            The filling out of the ballot must happen personally and secretly. You can find an unoffical translated version of the ballot text <a href="{{ path('info') }}">here</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Fold the ballot and place it in the ballot envelope. </b>Make sure that only the ballot is in the ballot envelope.</li>
        <li><b>Seal the ballot envelope well.</b> To do this, pull the strip off the adhesive strip of the envelope and seal the envelope this way.</li>
        <li><b>Fill in the date on the ballot paper and sign the declaration by hand.</b> Unfortunately, without a signature your vote cannot be counted.</li>
        <li><b>Place the signed ballot and sealed ballot envelope in the return envelope.</b></li>
        <li><b>Seal the return envelope and write your return address on the lines at the top left of the return envelope.</b></li>
    </ol>
    The return envelope is now ready to be mailed.
